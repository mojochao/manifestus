The `manifestus` CLI is a tool to render Kubernetes resource manifests for
multiple environments of a stack of one or more workloads defined in a loaded
configuration for management of Kubernetes cluster state in pull-based
[GitOps](https://opengitops.dev/) workflows with the
[Rendered Manifests](https://medium.com/@PlanB./rendered-manifests-pattern-the-new-standard-for-gitops-c0b9b020f3b6)
pattern, sometimes also called "manifest hydration".
